Quill Blog is a lightweight, minimal, statically compiled blogging framework intended for longform writing. Python on top of `staticjinja`. Implements tag collection, post categories, [RSS feed](feed.xml), and some other small convenience features I wanted without bloatware attached. Supports extended Markdown-to-HTML conversion. Very not productionized because I casually wrote this for myself.

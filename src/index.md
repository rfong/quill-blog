Quill is a lightweight, minimal, statically compiled blogging framework written in Python on top of `staticjinja`. Implements tag collection, post categories, [RSS feed](feed.xml), and some other small convenience features I wanted without bloatware attached. Supports extended Markdown -> HTML. Very not productionized.
